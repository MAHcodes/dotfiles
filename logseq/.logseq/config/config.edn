;; This global config file applies a configuration to all graphs. Any config
;; keys from a graph's logseq/config.edn can used here. A graph's
;; logseq/config.edn overrides config keys in this file except for maps which
;; are merged. As an example of merging, the following global and local
;; configs:
;;   {:shortcuts {:ui/toggle-theme "t z"}}
;;   {:shortcuts {:ui/toggle-brackets "t b"}}
;;
;;  would result in the final config:
;;   {:shortcuts {:ui/toggle-theme "t z"
;;                :ui/toggle-brackets "t b"}}
